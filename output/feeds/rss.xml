I use it all the time in my teaching. But, those of us working on &lt;a href="http://databrary.org"&gt;Databrary&lt;/a&gt; find ourselves saying "We're not YouTube" on a regular basis. Here's why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core community consists of researchers who study infant and child development. We use video to collect the richest possible sample of behavior in natural or laboratory settings. Video often contains faces, voices, and names spoken aloud. This means that the videos could be used to determine the identity of research participants. When researchers collect information from participants, we promise to protect their confidentiality and preserve their privacy. Those promises stem from longstanding principles of research ethics with human participants such as the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html"&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge comes in determining how to keep these promises while enabling researchers who haven't been part of the original data collection to see, and possibly use in their research, the recordings collected by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many others have spoken about the virtues of making data sharing common practice in science. Our colleagues at the &lt;a href="http://centerforopenscience.org/"&gt;Center for Open Science&lt;/a&gt; have been particularly visible on these topics, especially in behavioral science. The &lt;a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2012.705133?journalCode=hpli20#.VARTFWRdUsc"&gt;Databrary Team&lt;/a&gt; has weighed in on the issue, as well. Much more can and should be said on the matter, but I won't do so here. Instead, I'd like to explain how we solved the practical problem of sharing identifiable research data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's simple, really. We ask permission. Whether as part of the formal procedure when researchers ask permission or consent from a participant to study them or as a separate release related to photos and videos, we ask the people we've recorded to give permission to share the materials with &lt;em&gt;other researchers&lt;/em&gt;. This is one way we aren't YouTube. We restrict &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; will have access to Databrary. We also require researchers who want access to sign a &lt;a href="http://databrary.org/user-guide/getting-authorized.html"&gt;formal agreement&lt;/a&gt; to become authorized. The researcher's institution has to sign, as well. Researchers granted access promise to protect confidentiality of research participants and follow other ethical practices. YouTube has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms"&gt;terms of service agreement&lt;/a&gt; that every user has agreed to, but how many of us have actually read it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want Databrary to be as easy to use and as powerful as YouTube, but with a much more limited target audience, with users who've read the terms of service and understood their responsibilities, and with more constraints on how the materials will be used. To do so, we've tried to strike a balance between enabling greater video data sharing while holding true to ethical principles governing research conduct. Some balancing acts are easier than others, but we're optimistic this approach will work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-09-01:striking a balance.html</guid><category>Databrary</category><category>data sharing</category></item><item><title>Paddling and pedaling</title><link>http://rick-gilmore.org/paddling-and-pedaling.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of my most vivid memories from the year and a half my family spent living in Madison, Wisconsin was the very instant my dad let go of the purple banana seat on my new stingray bicycle for the first time. I thought I was flying. That first moment of self-propulsion at speed must have been something like that Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong experienced on lift-off earlier that same summer. I was driving a rocket ship along the roads of Eagle Heights. That moment began a life-time love with cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later at Boy Scout camp in the Colorado Rockies, I opted out of the swim test that was part of the orientation. The water from the mountain lake was cold even in the late July afternoon of our arrival, and I never cared much for swimming. But, I needed to pass that test in order to try canoeing, and I wanted to try paddling very, very much. Watching the other boys take out into the middle of the lake with their canoes, I realized I'd made a terrible mistake. The camp counselors offered a second-chance swim test for those of us who'd passed up the first chance. There was only one catch -- it would be at 7:00 am. I'm convinced I swam the fastest 100 yards in history, temperature assisted of course. The prize was worth it. I got to paddle a canoe for the first time, and that thrill has not diminished in the decades since. Today's kayak outing with friends was as satisfying as my first time in a canoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the same thrill the one and only time I got to steer a sailboat. And, while I love the speed of downhill skiing and more recently snowboarding, I find myself drawn to cross country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something about getting from here to there by human, or wind, or water, or gravity's power that appeals to me in a deep way. It's not just the quiet. I do love that. Or, the exercise -- it's more satisfying to side-step up a small hill and ski down it than to freeze on a long chair lift ride. It's an aesthetic. Cycling, paddling, and sailing are beautiful. They satisfy a deep human need to wander, but enable it without diminishing our sense of wonder. If only those human powered airplanes weren't so hard to store in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-30:paddling-and-pedaling.html</guid><category>padling</category><category>cycling</category></item><item><title>All aboard</title><link>http://rick-gilmore.org/all-aboard.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Metro North Train Along Hudson" src="http://nycsubway.org.s3.amazonaws.com/images/icon/title_world_us_metronorth_hudson.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was a railroad man. He worked the freight line from Rawlins, Wyoming to Green River. He'd always tease us by saying "I say UP on a boxcar," but that really meant he was a proud employee of the Union Pacific. One employee benefit was discounted tickets on the UP's passenger line service. Some of my best memories of traveling to Rawlins from Denver involved long bouts in the observation car watching that beautiful Wyoming emptiness roll on by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've loved trains and train travel ever since. I love subways, cable cars, you name it. I took the train from Berkely to Eugene once. A trip that should have lasted 12 hours took 18. Thank you freight owners for ignoring the federal rule that passenger trains should have the right-of-way. But, in truth, I didn't mind. The long, slow approach to Mt. Shasta was gorgeous, only exceeded by the slow crawl around that magnificent cone and the twisty descent along the Wilamette into Eugene. The route from San Diego to LA is also a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm on the Empire service along the mighty Hudson, another scenic route. America has decimated its train service, but it's still the best way to travel if you really want to enjoy the ride. The seat room is better than United, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-29:all-aboard.html</guid><category>trains</category><category>travel</category></item><item><title>Apple of my eye</title><link>http://rick-gilmore.org/apple-of-my-eye.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Databrary" src="images/databrary-name.png" /&gt;&lt;img alt="Datavyu" src="images/datavyu-name.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on the Megabus to New York. It's time to check in with the &lt;a href="http://databrary"&gt;Databrary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://datavyu.org"&gt;Datavyu&lt;/a&gt; project teams. We're hiring, by the way. So, if you are a &lt;a href="http://databrary.org/about/jobs/ux-ui.html"&gt;UI/UX&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://databrary.org/about/jobs/front-end.html"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; developer, please consider applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't wait to open the site to the general public later this fall. We already have a set of fascinating video data and dynamic displays from a wide range of researchers. If you are a researcher who wants to share data, consider &lt;a href="http://nyu.databrary.org/register"&gt;registering&lt;/a&gt; for the private beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are benefits to having a project that requires periodic travel to the Big Apple. Does anyone call it that anymore? The capital of the world, a French friend once called it. Or, the City. Whatever you call it, I enjoy going. And, I enjoy working with these colleagues on this project a great deal. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-27:apple-of-my-eye.html</guid><category>data-sharing</category><category>Databrary</category><category>Datavyu</category></item><item><title>A king for the ages</title><link>http://rick-gilmore.org/a-king-for-the-ages.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We saw the &lt;a href="http://nittanyvalleyshakespearecompany.com/"&gt;Nittany Valley Shakespeare Company's&lt;/a&gt; production of "King Lear" last night at The State Theatre. It featured retiring Professor of Theatre, Charles Dumas, in the title role, and a cast of both local and regional actors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered Lear as a high school senior. Mr. Carter was one of those high school teachers who pushed students beyond what they imagine they are capable of themselves. He challenged the class to write an essay on the theme of "nothing", one that emerges consistently throughout the play. I took the bait. My essay focused on the irony of the theme, given all that happens to Lear and his minions. Mr. Carter wanted me to look into the void and see nothingness as the focus of Lear's fear and ultimate fate. I see the void more clearly in my 50's than I did at 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire the NVSC for taking on this challenging work. There were some terrific performances. Seeing Lear for the first time, I understand more why it is so rarely performed. The story starts out with injustice and betrayal, and ends, true to form, with most of the main characters dead. We Americans like to pretend that tragedy happens to other people, usually far away. Lear reminds us otherwise; the void is unknowably near. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-24:a-king-for-the-ages.html</guid><category>theatre</category><category>shakespeare</category></item><item><title>Bite-sized chunks</title><link>http://rick-gilmore.org/bite-sized-chunks.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I'm running again. Or, I should say I'm running consistently 3 or 4 times a week. Not far yet, and not fast. As my dad would say, I'm "half-fast." My initial goal is to run consistently, with less emphasis on distance and speed. Good habits are hard to make, so I'm focusing on making this a habit, not a fad. It helps that I have a Suunto Ambit2 watch that clocks my distance, path, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying a similar scheme in skill learning. Normally, I'm a dabbler. I like to try-out new skills, and my bookshelf shows. But, I often don't keep focused long enough to reach beyond the advanced beginner stage. My current goals are to become fluent enough in Python to write code I actually need in my work, and to freshen up my CSS and HTML enough to create decent static websites from scratch. To do this, I'm borrowing the strategy I'm using in my exercise regime -- work consistently on a regular basis in small blocks of time. This post, using the Python-based site generator &lt;a href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/3.4.0/index.html"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; is a first step on the path.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone should create the equivalent of coding 5Ks and 10Ks. Geeks like t-shirts, right? Couch-to-JavaScript-enabled site anyone?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rick Gilmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-24:bite-sized-chunks.html</guid><category>running</category><category>Python</category><category>Pelican</category></item></channel></rss>
