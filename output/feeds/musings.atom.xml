I thought I was flying. That first moment of self-propulsion at speed must have been something like that Collins, Aldrin, and Armstrong experienced on lift-off earlier that same summer. I was driving a rocket ship along the roads of Eagle Heights. That moment began a life-time love with cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years later at Boy Scout camp in the Colorado Rockies, I opted out of the swim test that was part of the orientation. The water from the mountain lake was cold even in the late July afternoon of our arrival, and I never cared much for swimming. But, I needed to pass that test in order to try canoeing, and I wanted to try paddling very, very much. Watching the other boys take out into the middle of the lake with their canoes, I realized I'd made a terrible mistake. The camp counselors offered a second-chance swim test for those of us who'd passed up the first chance. There was only one catch -- it would be at 7:00 am. I'm convinced I swam the fastest 100 yards in history, temperature assisted of course. The prize was worth it. I got to paddle a canoe for the first time, and that thrill has not diminished in the decades since. Today's kayak outing with friends was as satisfying as my first time in a canoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt the same thrill the one and only time I got to steer a sailboat. And, while I love the speed of downhill skiing and more recently snowboarding, I find myself drawn to cross country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something about getting from here to there by human, or wind, or water, or gravity's power that appeals to me in a deep way. It's not just the quiet. I do love that. Or, the exercise -- it's more satisfying to side-step up a small hill and ski down it than to freeze on a long chair lift ride. It's an aesthetic. Cycling, paddling, and sailing are beautiful. They satisfy a deep human need to wander, but enable it without diminishing our sense of wonder. If only those human powered airplanes weren't so hard to store in the garage.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="padling"></category><category term="cycling"></category></entry><entry><title>All aboard</title><link href="http://rick-gilmore.org/all-aboard.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rick Gilmore</name></author><id>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-29:all-aboard.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Metro North Train Along Hudson" src="http://nycsubway.org.s3.amazonaws.com/images/icon/title_world_us_metronorth_hudson.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was a railroad man. He worked the freight line from Rawlins, Wyoming to Green River. He'd always tease us by saying "I say UP on a boxcar," but that really meant he was a proud employee of the Union Pacific. One employee benefit was discounted tickets on the UP's passenger line service. Some of my best memories of traveling to Rawlins from Denver involved long bouts in the observation car watching that beautiful Wyoming emptiness roll on by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've loved trains and train travel ever since. I love subways, cable cars, you name it. I took the train from Berkely to Eugene once. A trip that should have lasted 12 hours took 18. Thank you freight owners for ignoring the federal rule that passenger trains should have the right-of-way. But, in truth, I didn't mind. The long, slow approach to Mt. Shasta was gorgeous, only exceeded by the slow crawl around that magnificent cone and the twisty descent along the Wilamette into Eugene. The route from San Diego to LA is also a must-see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm on the Empire service along the mighty Hudson, another scenic route. America has decimated its train service, but it's still the best way to travel if you really want to enjoy the ride. The seat room is better than United, too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="trains"></category><category term="travel"></category></entry><entry><title>A king for the ages</title><link href="http://rick-gilmore.org/a-king-for-the-ages.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rick Gilmore</name></author><id>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-24:a-king-for-the-ages.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We saw the &lt;a href="http://nittanyvalleyshakespearecompany.com/"&gt;Nittany Valley Shakespeare Company's&lt;/a&gt; production of "King Lear" last night at The State Theatre. It featured retiring Professor of Theatre, Charles Dumas, in the title role, and a cast of both local and regional actors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered Lear as a high school senior. Mr. Carter was one of those high school teachers who pushed students beyond what they imagine they are capable of themselves. He challenged the class to write an essay on the theme of "nothing", one that emerges consistently throughout the play. I took the bait. My essay focused on the irony of the theme, given all that happens to Lear and his minions. Mr. Carter wanted me to look into the void and see nothingness as the focus of Lear's fear and ultimate fate. I see the void more clearly in my 50's than I did at 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire the NVSC for taking on this challenging work. There were some terrific performances. Seeing Lear for the first time, I understand more why it is so rarely performed. The story starts out with injustice and betrayal, and ends, true to form, with most of the main characters dead. We Americans like to pretend that tragedy happens to other people, usually far away. Lear reminds us otherwise; the void is unknowably near. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="theatre"></category><category term="shakespeare"></category></entry><entry><title>Bite-sized chunks</title><link href="http://rick-gilmore.org/bite-sized-chunks.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Rick Gilmore</name></author><id>tag:rick-gilmore.org,2014-08-24:bite-sized-chunks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm running again. Or, I should say I'm running consistently 3 or 4 times a week. Not far yet, and not fast. As my dad would say, I'm "half-fast." My initial goal is to run consistently, with less emphasis on distance and speed. Good habits are hard to make, so I'm focusing on making this a habit, not a fad. It helps that I have a Suunto Ambit2 watch that clocks my distance, path, and heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying a similar scheme in skill learning. Normally, I'm a dabbler. I like to try-out new skills, and my bookshelf shows. But, I often don't keep focused long enough to reach beyond the advanced beginner stage. My current goals are to become fluent enough in Python to write code I actually need in my work, and to freshen up my CSS and HTML enough to create decent static websites from scratch. To do this, I'm borrowing the strategy I'm using in my exercise regime -- work consistently on a regular basis in small blocks of time. This post, using the Python-based site generator &lt;a href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/3.4.0/index.html"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; is a first step on the path.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone should create the equivalent of coding 5Ks and 10Ks. Geeks like t-shirts, right? Couch-to-JavaScript-enabled site anyone?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="running"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="Pelican"></category></entry></feed>
