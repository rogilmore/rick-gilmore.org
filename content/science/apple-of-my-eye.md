Summary: Fostering open data-sharing with Databrary and Datavyu

I'm on the Megabus to New York. It's time to check in with the [Databrary](http://databrary) and [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org) project teams. We're hiring, by the way. So, if you are a [UI/UX](http://databrary.org/about/jobs/ux-ui.html) or [JavaScript](http://databrary.org/about/jobs/front-end.html) developer, please consider applying.

We can't wait to open the site to the general public later this fall. We already have a set of fascinating video data and dynamic displays from a wide range of researchers. If you are a researcher who wants to share data, consider [registering](http://nyu.databrary.org/register) for the private beta.

Of course, there are benefits to having a project that requires periodic travel to the Big Apple. Does anyone call it that anymore? The capital of the world, a French friend once called it. Or, the City. Whatever you call it, I enjoy going. And, I enjoy working with these colleagues on this project a great deal.
